# Managing Hierarchies

Practice for defining and implementing classes that use inheritance. The class inheritance of this project is visualized below:

### Prerequisites

A development environment will be needed to test this project. [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/) was used for the development of this project and is the recommended environment.

### Testing

Tests for this project can be run through the command line. Sample inputs and outputs can be found in the files:

```
sample_input.txt
sample_output.txt
```

These test the program's ability to create objects of the leaf classes (Cluster and Personal_surveillance_device) and tests the ability to set member variables and run member functions.
